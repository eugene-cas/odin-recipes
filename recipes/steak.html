    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it 
        taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make 
        the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy 
        inside.</p>
    <p>This 20-minute recipe is done on the stovetop in one pan (no need to finish 
        it in the oven). This is one of our favorite steak recipes and we make it
        year-round because it’s such a quick and convenient cooking method. That 
        garlic butter is lip-smacking good! Read on for great tips on how to 
        improve, reduce food waste and you will love our ideas for easy meal prep 
        with leftover steak.</p>
